###### Artificial Intelligence
This is some of the most interesting exercises I performance during my master in Artificial Intelligence. Explanations inside the code are in spanish though...

- **Clusteing**
    Apply clustering with dimensionality reduction. I use the algorithm _K-Means_ with [the whole sale customer dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers) to analyze the annual customer expense in different types of grocery

- **Image Processing**  
    Noise treatment in an image using the most popular filter for that purpose.

- **Morphology**   
   Image binarization in order to count the number of point in the picture.

- **POS Tagger**    
   Build a POS tagger using a HMM model with Vitebi decoding.

- **Puzzle8**   
   Resolves Puzzle8 problem with A* algorithm applying heuristics based on Manhattan distance.

- **Segmentation**   
   Apply image segmentation to separate one qualitatively different part of an image from another. It uses several algorithms and analyze the final result.

- **Naive Bayes**   
   Apply Naive Bayes classifier to predict between two classes (_democrat_ or _republican_) from a US votation result.

- **Random Forest**   
   Apply random forest to predict the number of bikes sales per hour from [this dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)
